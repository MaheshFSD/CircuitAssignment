Hello, this page gives nformation about how movieDataScraping works. 

here in this page all the data of a movie is not in a single page. so what i did?
1. using tamil movies page i scraped all the movie rls.
2. i visited all the movie url pages and scraped movie meta data and 


Actually https://letterboxd.com/  is nor allowed ❌web scraping. I confirmed this by visiting https://letterboxd.com/robots.txt 
here all user agents are disallowed.

So i respected their efforts and didn't proceed with the web scraping.
But i wrote code which will scrape all the movie data if web scroping allowed in the page.
And also for doing sentimental analysis i mocked some data similar to this movie data. 

I stored this data in ✅ Mongodb.
